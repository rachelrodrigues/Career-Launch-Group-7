# HeartInsight

HeartInsight is a mobile app developed in Flutter that predicts a user's risk of heart disease using a logistic regression model. The app guides users through a series of health-related questions — including age, gender, weight, blood pressure, and more — and provides an estimated risk score based on their responses.

## 🧠 Motivation

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. With HeartInsight, our goal is to provide a lightweight, accessible tool that helps users better understand their personal risk factors using data-driven insights.

This project was developed as part of the Break Through Tech Career Launch program.
